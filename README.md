General Purpose Gradient Boosting Library

Intention: A stand-alone efficient library to do machine learning in functional space

Planned key components (TODO):

(1) Gradient boosting models: 
    - regression tree
    - linear model/lasso
(2) Objectives to support tasks: 
    - regression
    - classification
    - ranking
    - matrix factorization
    - structured prediction
(3) OpenMP support for parallelization(optional)
