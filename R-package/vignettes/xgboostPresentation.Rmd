Introduction
============

The purpose of this Vignette is to show you how to use **Xgboost** to make prediction from a model based on your own dataset.

You may know **Xgboost** as a state of the art tool to build some kind of Machine learning models. It has been [used](https://github.com/tqchen/xgboost) to win several [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com) competition. 

For the purpose of this tutorial we will first load the required packages.

```{r libLoading, results='hold', message=F, warning=F}
require(xgboost)
require(methods)
```

In this example, we are aiming to predict whether a mushroom can be eated.

Learning
========

Dataset loading
---------------

We load the `agaricus` datasets and link it to variables.

The dataset is already separated in `train` and `test` data. 

As their names imply, the train part will be used to build the model and the test part to check how well our model works. Without separation we would test the model on data the algorithm have already seen, as you may imagine, it's not the best methodology to check the performance of a prediction (would it even be a prediction?).

```{r datasetLoading, results='hold', message=F, warning=F}
data(agaricus.train, package='xgboost')
data(agaricus.test, package='xgboost')
train <- agaricus.train
test <- agaricus.test
```

> In the reality, it would be up to you to make this division between `train` and `test` data.

> Each variable is a S3 object containing both label and data.

The loaded data is stored in `dgCMatrix` which is a **sparse matrix** type. 

Label is a `numeric` vector in `{0,1}`.

```{r dataClass, message=F, warning=F}
class(train$data)[1]
class(train$label)
```

Basic Training using XGBoost
----------------------------

The most critical part of the process is the training.

We are using the train data. Both `data` and `label` are in each data (explained above). To access to the field of a `S3` object we use the `$` character in **R**.

> label is the outcome of our dataset. It is the classification we want to predict. For these data we already have it, but when our model is built, that is this column we want to guess.

In sparse matrix, cells which contains `0` are not encoded. Therefore, in a dataset where there are plenty of `0`, dataset size is optimized. It is very usual to have such dataset. Xgboost can manage both dense and sparse matrix.

```{r trainingSparse, message=F, warning=F}
bstSparse <- xgboost(data = train$data, label = train$label, max.depth = 2, eta = 1, nround = 2, objective = "binary:logistic")
```

Alternatively, you can put your dataset in a dense matrix, i.e. a basic R-matrix.

```{r trainingDense, message=F, warning=F}
bstDense <- xgboost(data = as.matrix(train$data), label = train$label, max.depth = 2, eta = 1, nround = 2,
               objective = "binary:logistic")
```

Above, data and label are not stored together. 

Xgboost offer a way to group them in a `xgb.DMatrix`. You can even add other meta data. It will be usefull for the most advanced features.

```{r trainingDense, message=F, warning=F}
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = train$data, label = train$label)
bst <- xgboost(data = dtrain, max.depth = 2, eta = 1, nround = 2, objective = "binary:logistic")
```

# Verbose = 0,1,2
print ('train xgboost with verbose 0, no message')
bst <- xgboost(data = dtrain, max.depth = 2, eta = 1, nround = 2,
               objective = "binary:logistic", verbose = 0)
print ('train xgboost with verbose 1, print evaluation metric')
bst <- xgboost(data = dtrain, max.depth = 2, eta = 1, nround = 2,
               objective = "binary:logistic", verbose = 1)
print ('train xgboost with verbose 2, also print information about tree')
bst <- xgboost(data = dtrain, max.depth = 2, eta = 1, nround = 2,
               objective = "binary:logistic", verbose = 2)

# you can also specify data as file path to a LibSVM format input
# since we do not have this file with us, the following line is just for illustration
# bst <- xgboost(data = 'agaricus.train.svm', max.depth = 2, eta = 1, nround = 2,objective = "binary:logistic")

#--------------------basic prediction using xgboost--------------
# you can do prediction using the following line
# you can put in Matrix, sparseMatrix, or xgb.DMatrix 
pred <- predict(bst, test$data)
err <- mean(as.numeric(pred > 0.5) != test$label)
print(paste("test-error=", err))

#-------------------save and load models-------------------------
# save model to binary local file
xgb.save(bst, "xgboost.model")
# load binary model to R
bst2 <- xgb.load("xgboost.model")
pred2 <- predict(bst2, test$data)
# pred2 should be identical to pred
print(paste("sum(abs(pred2-pred))=", sum(abs(pred2-pred))))

# save model to R's raw vector
raw = xgb.save.raw(bst)
# load binary model to R
bst3 <- xgb.load(raw)
pred3 <- predict(bst3, test$data)
# pred2 should be identical to pred
print(paste("sum(abs(pred3-pred))=", sum(abs(pred2-pred))))

#----------------Advanced features --------------
# to use advanced features, we need to put data in xgb.DMatrix
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = train$data, label=train$label)
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = test$data, label=test$label)
#---------------Using watchlist----------------
# watchlist is a list of xgb.DMatrix, each of them tagged with name
watchlist <- list(train=dtrain, test=dtest)
# to train with watchlist, use xgb.train, which contains more advanced features
# watchlist allows us to monitor the evaluation result on all data in the list 
print ('train xgboost using xgb.train with watchlist')
bst <- xgb.train(data=dtrain, max.depth=2, eta=1, nround=2, watchlist=watchlist,
                 objective = "binary:logistic")
# we can change evaluation metrics, or use multiple evaluation metrics
print ('train xgboost using xgb.train with watchlist, watch logloss and error')
bst <- xgb.train(data=dtrain, max.depth=2, eta=1, nround=2, watchlist=watchlist,
                 eval.metric = "error", eval.metric = "logloss",
                 objective = "binary:logistic")

# xgb.DMatrix can also be saved using xgb.DMatrix.save
xgb.DMatrix.save(dtrain, "dtrain.buffer")
# to load it in, simply call xgb.DMatrix
dtrain2 <- xgb.DMatrix("dtrain.buffer")
bst <- xgb.train(data=dtrain2, max.depth=2, eta=1, nround=2, watchlist=watchlist,
                 objective = "binary:logistic")
# information can be extracted from xgb.DMatrix using getinfo
label = getinfo(dtest, "label")
pred <- predict(bst, dtest)
err <- as.numeric(sum(as.integer(pred > 0.5) != label))/length(label)
print(paste("test-error=", err))

# You can dump the tree you learned using xgb.dump into a text file
xgb.dump(bst, "dump.raw.txt", with.stats = T)

# Finally, you can check which features are the most important.
print("Most important features (look at column Gain):")
print(xgb.importance(feature_names = train$data@Dimnames[[2]], filename_dump = "dump.raw.txt"))
